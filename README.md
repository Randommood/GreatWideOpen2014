Great Wide Open 2014
=================

The goal of this workshop is for you to understand the pros/cons of a given database and identify the situations when its best suited. We have two parts, one dedicated to relational databases and another dedicated to a few pervasive NoSQL databases. Note that a little theory will be presented in both sections.

Each part is self-contained and I'll do my best to keep things as interactive as possible. If you have any particular topics you'd like me to cover please open an issue in this repo and I'll do my best to accomodate your needs.

Note that both talks are targeted towards a developer audience. Though some operational concepts are discussed I assume you have little to some Database knowledge and want to learn more.


Workshop 1 - Relational Databases in the Cloud
------------------
**Time & Place:** Wednesday April 2nd from 2:30PM-3:15PM - [Developer 1 Track](http://greatwideopen.org/schedule.php)

In this session we'll go over the two most common open source relational databases. We'll start with a quick introduction to relational theory and an overview of why this technology is still powerful and relevant.
We will address the challenges and operational specifics of developing against relational databases on Cloud environments.

Workshop 2 - NoSQL Databases in the Cloud
--------------------------

In this session we'll introduce NoSQL databases and the movement's emerging patterns. We will contrast them to the concepts presented in workshop 1 (attendance is not mandatory).
We will discuss a few of the most common open source NoSQL databases, their strengths, use cases, and their operational stories when running in the Cloud.
